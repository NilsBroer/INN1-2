Goals for INN1:
 - Creating a private blockchain in a local environment [X]
 - Creating a private FH-network. [X]
 - Implement use-case: Create a process to safe immutable voting-results on the blockchain. [X]
     - The first version of the main contract shall allow to create a collection of parties to vote for
     - and allow time-restricted access
     - for students to vote (restricted by ID).
     - Properly test the existing contract for mistakes
 - Deploy contract on FH-Blockchain (and run) [ ]
 
TODO (leftover):
 - Finding a way to make voting anonymous (currently input-variables are viewable).
 - Deploy contract on FH-Blockchain (and run)
 - Finding a way to make voting securer and more user-friendly
      - Potentially using AKAP or MetaMask
 - Extending the scope of the voting-contract
